# PrawWallpaperDownloader (Python3)

Download the top voted wallpapers from the subreddit r/wallpapers, this project is still in its baby stages, but eventually I plan to make a wallpaper switching script that downloads a series of wallpapers, displays them and lets you change you wallpaper with a push of a button.

Inspirations is drawn from [Daily-Reddit-Wallpaper](https://github.com/ssimunic/Daily-Reddit-Wallpaper)
